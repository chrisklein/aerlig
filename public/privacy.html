<p class="style6"><b>Your privacy is important to Aerlig Capital, LLC ("Aerlig"); maintaining your trust is paramount to us.</b></p>
<p class="style6">This Statement discloses the information practices for Aerlig's and our affiliates' Web sites, including what type of information is gathered and tracked, how the information is used, and with whom the information is shared. </p> 
<p class="style6">This Statement applies to Aerlig Web sites that link to this Statement but does not apply to those Aerlig Web sites that have their own Privacy Statement. From time to time, we may supplement this Statement with additional information relating to a particular interaction we have with you. </p>
<p class="style6"><b>Collection of Personal Information</b></p>
<p class="style6">You may choose to give us personal information directly in a variety of situations. For example, you may want to give us your name and contact information to communicate with you, to process an order, to provide you with a subscription or a service, or to do business with us if you are a supplier or a business partner. You may also provide your credit card details to buy something from us or may share a description of your education and work experience in connection with a job opening at Aerlig for which you wish to be considered. If you tell us that you do not want us to use your information to make further contact with you beyond fulfilling your request, we will respect your wishes. </p>
<p class="style6">We may also collect information relating to your use of our Web sites through the use of various technologies. For example, when you visit our Web sites, we may log certain information that your browser sends us, such as your IP address, browser type and language, access time, and referring Web site addresses. We may also collect information about the pages you view within our sites and other actions you take while visiting us. In addition, we may also use such technologies to determine whether you've opened an e-mail or clicked on a link contained in an e-mail. Collecting information in this manner allows us to collect statistics about our Web sites usage and effectiveness and personalize your experience while you are on our Web sites, as well as tailor our interactions with you. For details regarding the technologies we employ, see "Cookies and Other Technologies" below. </p>
<p class="style6">From time to time, we may also collect information that pertains to you indirectly through other sources, such as list vendors. When we do so, we ask the vendors to confirm that the information was legally acquired by the third party and that we have the right to obtain it from them and use it. </p>
<p class="style6">The information that we collect, either directly or indirectly, may be combined to help us improve its overall accuracy and completeness and to help us better tailor our interactions with you.</p>
<p class="style6"><b>Use of Personal Information</b></p>
<p class="style6">The following paragraphs describe in more detail how Aerlig may use your personal information. </p>
<p class="style6">If you request something from Aerlig, for example, a product or service, a callback, or specific marketing materials, we will use the information you provide to fulfill your request. To help us do this, we may share information with others, for instance, Aerlig's business partners, financial institutions, shipping companies, or postal or government authorities, such as Customs authorities, involved in fulfillment. In connection with a transaction, we may also contact you as part of our customer satisfaction surveys or for market research purposes.</p>
<p class="style6">We may use information we collect about you to provide you with a personalized experience on our Web sites, such as providing you with content in which you may be interested and making navigation on our sites easier. </p>
<p class="style6">We may use your personal information to support products or services you have obtained from us, such as notifying you of a product recall or fix. We may also provide "Live Chat" sessions on our Web sites to assist you while you're navigating through our sites; we will use personal information you provide via these sessions in accordance with this Privacy Statement. 
</p>
<p class="style6">The information you provide to Aerlig, as well as the information we have collected about you indirectly, may be used by Aerlig for marketing purposes. Before we do so, however, we will offer you the opportunity to choose whether or not to have your information used in this way. You may at any time choose not to receive marketing materials from us by following the unsubscribe instructions included in each e-mail you may receive, by indicating so when we call you, or by contacting us directly. </p>
<p class="style6">Some of our offerings may be co-branded, that is sponsored by both Aerlig and third parties. If you sign up for these offerings, be aware that your information may also be collected by and shared with those third parties. We encourage you to familiarize yourself with their privacy policies to gain an understanding of the manner in which they will handle information about you. </p>

<p class="style6">If you choose to "Email This Page" to a friend or colleague, we will ask for their name and e-mail address. We will automatically send a one-time e-mail sharing the page you indicated, but will not use that information for other purposes. </p>

<p class="style6">In connection with a job application or inquiry, whether advertised on an Aerlig Web site or otherwise, you may provide us with information about yourself, such as a resume. We may use this information throughout Aerlig in order to address your inquiry or consider you for employment purposes. Unless you tell us not to do so, we may keep the information for future consideration. </p>

<p class="style6">Certain online transactions may involve you calling us or us calling you. They may also involve online chats. Please be aware that it is Aerlig's general practice to monitor and in some cases record such interactions for staff training or quality assurance purposes or to retain evidence of a particular transaction or interaction. </p>

<p class="style6">We may also use or share your information to protect the rights or property of Aerlig, our business partners, suppliers, clients, or others when we have reasonable grounds to believe that such rights or property have been or could be affected. In addition, we reserve the right to disclose your personal information as required by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, or the rights of others, or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on our Web sites. </p>

<p class="style6">If you represent an Aerlig business partner, you may visit Aerlig Web sites intended specifically for Aerlig business partners. We may use information provided on that site to administer and develop our business relationship with you, the business partner you represent, and Aerlig business partners generally. For instance, this may involve using your information to send you details of Aerlig programs. It may also include sharing certain information with other business partners (subject to any confidentiality obligations that may exist), or Aerlig customers or prospects. In connection with a particular transaction or program, we may also contact you as part of customer satisfaction surveys or for market research purposes. </p>

<p class="style6">If you represent an Aerlig supplier, you may visit Aerlig Web sites intended specifically for use by Aerlig suppliers. We may use the information provided on that site in connection with entering into or performing a transaction with you. For example, this may include sharing information with other parts of Aerlig, Aerlig's business partners, customers, shipping companies, financial institutions and postal or government authorities involved in fulfillment. It may also be used to administer and develop our relationship with you, the supplier you represent, and other Aerlig suppliers generally.</p>

<p class="style6"><b>Sharing of Personal Information and International Transfers</b></p>

<p class="style6">Aerlig is a global organization with business processes, management structures and technical systems that cross borders. As such, we may share information about you within Aerlig and transfer it to countries in the world where we do business in connection with the uses identified above and in accordance with this Privacy Statement. Our Privacy Statement and our practices are designed to provide a globally consistent level of protection for personal information all over the world. This means that even in countries whose laws provide for less protection for your information, Aerlig will still handle your information in the manner described here. </p>

<p class="style6">In some cases, Aerlig uses suppliers located in various countries to collect, use, analyze, and otherwise process information on its behalf. It is Aerlig's practice to require such suppliers to handle information in a manner consistent with Aerlig's policies. </p>

<p class="style6">From time to time, we may disclose information that identifies you at an individual level and which we collected on our Web sites to other non-Aerlig entities that are not acting as our suppliers, such as our business partners. Except as described in this Privacy Statement, we will only do so with your prior consent. We do not sell or lease such information however. </p>

<p class="style6">Circumstances may arise where, whether for strategic or other business reasons, Aerlig decides to sell, buy, merge or otherwise reorganize businesses in some countries. Such a transaction may involve the disclosure of personal information to prospective or actual purchasers, or the receipt of such information from sellers. It is Aerlig's practice to seek appropriate protection for information in these types of transactions. </p>

<p class="style6">Please be aware that in certain circumstances, personal information may be subject to disclosure to government agencies pursuant to judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process. We may also share your information to protect the rights or property of Aerlig, our business partners, suppliers or clients, and others when we have reasonable grounds to believe that such rights or property have been or could be affected. </p>

<p class="style6"><b>Information Security and Accuracy</b></p>

<p class="style6">We intend to protect your personal information and to maintain its accuracy. Aerlig implements reasonable physical, administrative and technical safeguards to help us protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use and disclosure. For example, we encrypt certain sensitive personal information such as credit card information when we transmit such information over the Internet. We also require that our suppliers protect such information from unauthorized access, use and disclosure.  </p>

<p class="style6"><b>Cookies and Other Technologies</b></p>

<p class="style6">As mentioned above, we collect information from your visits to our Web sites to help us gather statistics about our Web sites usage and effectiveness, personalize your experience on our sites, and tailor our interactions with you. We do so through the use of various technologies, including one called "cookies". A cookie is a piece of data that a Web site can send to your browser, which may then be stored on your computer as a tag that identifies your computer. While cookies are often only used to measure Web site usage and effectiveness and to allow for ease of navigation or use and as such, are not associated with any personal information, they are also used at times to personalize a known visitor's experience to a Web site by being associated with profile information or user preferences. You can set your browser in most instances to notify you before you receive a cookie, giving you the chance to decide whether to accept it or not. You can also generally set your browser to turn off cookies. Since cookies allow you to take advantage of some of our Web sites' features, we recommend that you leave them turned on. If you block or otherwise reject our cookies, you will not be able, for instance, to use any Web site services that require you to sign in. 
</p>

<p class="style6"><b>Online Advertising</b></p>

<p class="style6">Aerlig does not deliver third party online advertisements on our Web sites but we advertise our products and services on others' Web sites. We may collaborate with Web site operators as well as network advertisers to do so. Please familiarize yourself with those Web site operators' or network advertisers' privacy policies to understand their practices relating to advertising, including what type of information they may collect about your Internet usage. Aerlig does not provide any information relating to your usage of Aerlig Web sites to Web site operators or network advertisers. Some advertising networks we may use may be members of the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI). Individuals may opt-out of targeted advertising delivered by NAI member ad networks by visiting www.networkadvertising.org.  </p>

<p class="style6">Aerlig Web sites may contain links to non-Aerlig Web sites that are not affiliated with Aerlig. Aerlig is not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of those other Web sites.  </p>

<p class="style6"><b>Privacy Access</b></p>

<p class="style6">In certain cases, you may have the ability to view or edit your personal information online. In the event your information is not accessible online, and you wish to obtain a copy of particular information you provided to Aerlig, or if you become aware the information is incorrect and you would like us to correct it, please contact us. Before Aerlig is able to provide you with any information or correct any inaccuracies, however, we may ask you to verify your identity and to provide other details to help us to respond to your request. We will contact you within 30 days of your request. If you have questions or concerns regarding our Privacy Statement, you should first contact Aerlig directly.
